This README describes the basic structure of the API, including the available endpoints, data types, and security schemes. It also provides an example of how to use the API.
You can add more information like the types of parameters, request and response headers, and the different status codes of the API responses.
It's important to note that the example is just that, an example, the actual format of the API may vary and should be described in the OAS file.
Also the template should be written in YAML or JSON format, and the security scheme should be described in the OAS file.
